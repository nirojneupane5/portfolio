        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Niroj Neupane, a dedicated
          student and aspiring Information Management professional from

        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Education </h1>
        <p>
          I am currently in my eighth semester pursuing a Bachelor's degree in
          Information Management at Nepal Commerce Campus. Through my academic
          journey, I have developed a keen interest in harnessing the power of
          information technology to drive business success and facilitate
          efficient decision-making processes. My educational journey began with
          my secondary schooling, where I completed my +2 from VS Nitetan
          Secondary School and my Class 10 from Rainbow English Secondary
          School. These formative years provided me with a strong foundation in
          academics and instilled in me a passion for learning.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Passion for Technology</h1>
        <p>
          From a young age, I have been fascinated by the transformative
          potential of technology. Whether it's exploring the latest innovations
          or diving into coding projects, I thrive on the challenges and
          opportunities presented by the dynamic field of information
          management.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Professional Goals</h1>
        <p>
          As I approach the culmination of my academic journey, my ambition is
          to leverage my knowledge and skills to contribute meaningfully to the
          realm of Information Management. Whether it's through developing
          innovative software solutions, optimizing data management processes,
          or providing strategic IT consulting, I am eager to make a tangible
          impact in the field.
        </p>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Beyond the Classroom</h1>
        <p>
          In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively seek out opportunities
          for personal and professional growth. Whether it's attending
          workshops, participating in hackathons, or engaging in community
          service initiatives, I believe in the power of continuous learning and
          giving back to society.
